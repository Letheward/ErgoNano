# ErgoNano

ErgoNano is a ergonomic `nanorc` keybinding for GNU Nano.

Inspire by modern video games, ErgoNano's layout will greatly reduce your finger strain and give you a huge speedup.

## Installation

Put the `nanorc` file in your prefered `nanorc` location.

If you already have a custom one, **BACKUP** your `nanorc` first.  
Then manually copy everything below comments (`## === Keybindings ===`) to override your keybindings **ONLY**. 

If you don't know where, see GNU Nano's [Official Documentaion](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nanorc.5.html#FILES).
